Fluidroid
=========

A Fluidinfo client library for the Android platform.

Contents
========

* fluidinfo - the mobile client library
* fluidinfoTest - the test suite for the above

Setup
=====

You should follow the instructions for downloading and installing Eclipse and
the Android development environment here:

http://developer.android.com/index.html

Import the fluidinfo project
============================

* In Eclipse select: File -> New -> Android Project
* In the resulting dialog make sure "Create from existing source" is selected
in the "Contents" section. Make sure you browse to the "fluidinfo" directory.
* Click finish and the project should appear in Eclipse's Package Explorer
* Right click on the project and select "Refactor -> Rename" and make the new
name "fluidinfo" (this is so the test suite can find its references).

Configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
=========================================

An AVD is simply a VM for Android in which you run/test your application. You
need to make sure that you have one set up for the version of Android we're
targeting (Version 2.2 and above).

* Click Window -> Android SDK and AVD Manager
* Make sure "Virtual Devices" is selected on the left hand side
* There might be devices already configured. If so, look down the "platform"
column and if you see 2.2 then stop since this requirement is met.
* Click "New" and give the device a name, make sure the "Target" is "Android
2.2 - API Level 8" and that the SD Card is 16 MiB. Keep all the other settings
the same.
* Click the "Create AVD" button.

It'll now appear in the list of AVD devices available to you and will be used,
as required when running/testing Fluidroid.

If you just want to run the unit tests and work in an editor other than
Eclipse you can skip most of the rest of this an head straight to the bottom
for instructions on how to run the test-suite.

Import the Test Suite
=====================

* In Eclipse select: File -> New -> Java Project
* In the resulting dialog fill in the name as "fluidinfoTest" and  make sure 
"Create project from existing source" is selected in the "Contents" section
and ensure you browse to the "fluidinfoTest" directory.
* Click finish.

Running the Test Suite
======================

Most of the following information is extracted from here:

http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html

Using ANT is probably the quickest option.

From Within Eclipse
===================

Assuming you have both projects in your Package Explorer *without* any
warnings then you should be able to:

* Right-click on the test suite, select Run As -> Android JUnit Test
* You might have to wait a while as your AVD for Android 2.2 boots up - all
the unit tests are run within this device.
* Smile as the tests all pass and the Eclipse JUnit plugin shows green.

From the Commandline Using ANT
==============================

This is probably the easiest option to get the test suite running ASAP.

* From the root of the branch type::

    android update project --target 8 --path fluidinfo 
    android create test-project -m /absolute/path/to/fluidinfo -p /absolute/path/to/fluidinfoTest

I'm not sure why you need to use the absolute paths for the create
test-project command but relative paths don't work for me. Also, you can
safely ignore the "Please consider using 'android update' instead." error.

* cd into the fluidinfoTest directory and type::

    ant run-tests

You should see a bunch of compilation messages and might have to wait a while
as the Android VM boots up. But at the end you should see something like
this::

    run-tests:
    124 
    [echo] Running tests ...
    [exec] 
    [exec] com.fluidinfo.fluidinfo.test.FluidinfoProviderTest:...
    [exec] Time: 0.086
    [exec] 
    [exec] OK (3 tests)
    [exec] 
    [exec] 

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 14 seconds
